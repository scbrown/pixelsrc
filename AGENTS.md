# Agent Instructions

This project is managed by **Gas Town** (`gt`). Full context is injected at session start.

> **Recovery**: Run `gt prime` after compaction, clear, or new session.

## For Humans

If you're working manually (not as a gastown agent), use the justfile:

```bash
just ready            # Find available work
just issues           # List open issues
just status           # Git + issue status
```
